            <h2>What is Longboarding?</h2>
            <p>Longboarding is a sport with a variety of different disciplines, but they all have one thing in common: a
                longboard! A longboard is like a skateboard, but is typically a little longer, with bigger softer
                wheels, and with trucks designed more for turning rather than grinding rails. Longboards can be used to
                cruise around town, race down hills, do cool slide tricks, and much more. Ultimately, no matter what you
                do on the board, it's about creative expression and having a lot of fun! If you're looking for something
                exciting that will challenge you physically, then longboarding is for you!</p>

            <h2>The KLA Community</h2>
            <p>Here in Kelowna and the Okanagan area, we strive to maintain an inclusive, welcoming environment for the
                new skater and experienced rider alike! We host regular meetups to ride together, and learn new skills,
                including how to slide and stop on a longboard. At any meetup, you'll find a group of like-minded
                individuals who are stoked to skate, stoked to help eachother learn to skate, and stoked to promote safe
                skating! </p>

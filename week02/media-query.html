            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
                prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <h2>1 Nephi 10:19</h2>
            <p>For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the
                power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in
                times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round.</p>

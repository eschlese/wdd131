        <h1>Siteplan for Kelowna Longboard Alliance</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>The site name will be "Kelowna Longboard Alliance". This is the same name as the club. If I could pick a
            domain it would be kla.ca</p>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>This site will provide information on the local longboard club, including what kinds of longboarding we do.
            It will include some longboard media and links to media, a way to get in contact with members of the club,
            and a list of local longboard events.</p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>What is downhill longboarding? How/where can I learn to longboard/get better at longboarding? How can I meet up with the community?</p>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>This page will use the Roboto font for everything. While I want this page to look nice, I don't need it to look gorgeous. It's main purpose is to convey information, so I chose one font for simplicities sake.</p>
